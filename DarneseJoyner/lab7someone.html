 <h4> Grab yourself some icecream and sit down and watch this. This is the best breakup movie of all time. This moving is a bout Jenny (played by Gina Rodriguez) fresh out of a huge break up from her boyfriend Nate (played by LaKeith Stanfeild) and the adventures she goes through to get over him. She has her colose friends, Erin and Blair around to help her grow from this breakup.This movie helps people find truth and closure in a relationship that ended. This is my favorite movie because it is incredible relatable and I love how diverse the cast is. Also the soundtrack is amazing. I chose this background because the movie takes place in NYC so its easy to imagine myself in these positions. My favorite scene takes place in washinton square park where Jenny find time to herself and she has a self clarity moment.
