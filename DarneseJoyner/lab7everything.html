 <h4> This movie is simply beautiful. The way the characters portray emotion in a way that makes you wnat to jump in the screen and kiss them yourself. Its been my favorite movie for 3 years and it never fails to make me smile. The vocabulary is amazing and imformitave. In the movie the main character Maddy "suffers" from skid and immunie disorder that prevents her from going outside. Then she meets a Boy and find part of herself she would never find on her owm. Throughout the movie Maddy speaks about how if she could go anywhere she would go to the beach because she dosent feel small there. </h4>
