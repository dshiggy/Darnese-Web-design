 <p> The movie Call me by your Name was orginally a book written by Andre Aciman and turned into a movie in 2017. Cast mainly consists of Armiee Hammer and Timothee Chalamet playing forbidden love intrests.  Timothee plays Elio Pearlman The son of a Historian and Armiee plays Oliver an exchange student from the states learning under elios father. The film takes place in northern italy as a history trip where the main characters take a learning trip. While there Oliver and Elio develop feelings for eachother but given the circumstances of the world at the time, these feelings are compressed. Later on they learn what they have is real and they decide to follow theitr heart. This movoie perfectly depicts the progress Elio and Oliver made as a couple and as people. This is my favorite movie because the scenery is beyond beautiful and the language is interesting to follow. I chose this sparkly blue color sceme for this movie because  </p>
