 <h4> Where do i begin with this classic.This book turned movie is revolutionary and every woman and man should watch it. This movie has an astounding cast consisting of Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Laura durn and Timothee Chalamet. The movie takes place in massachucets dring the Civil War and shows the struggles these Women faced while their father was deployed in the war.This is my favorite movie because the roles are reversed in a way that empowers both genders. For example Timothee's character Lourie aka teddy had a commonly feminine name and is caring and sensitive, attributes that women are known for. On the other hand Saoirse's character Jo has a commonly male name and is strong, wise and head strong, Atributes a man would have. This movie related to Enola Holmes in that sence. I chose this these mor this movie because my favorite scene is when Jo and Teddy are on the grass hill and Teddy is pouring his heart out to Jo but she declines because she has other plans in life and refuses to be a sterotypical woman in the 1860's. </h4>
