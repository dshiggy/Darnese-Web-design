My name is Darnese Joyner. I was born February 6th 2006. Im an Aquarius. My pronouns are she/her. I love medicine, science and music. I play guitar and knit on my free time.
My favorite color is sage green and my favorite crystal is clear quartz. I am at Thoman edison bacuse my mother switched my schools behind my back and applied for visual arts. No complaints.
I want to be nothing but suscessful. I also would like to be a neurosurgeon or anything in the medical feild. Each tag represents a different task for the computer to do. For example mp3
instructs the computer to play audio.</p>
